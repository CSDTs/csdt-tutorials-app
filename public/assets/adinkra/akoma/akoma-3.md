# Draw the first line

The **line** block, located in the Pen category, allows you to draw a line at your current location. It takes in three values:

- **Length**: The length of the line. To draw your line forward, use a positive number. To draw your line backwards, use a negative number.
- **Pen Growth**: The rate at which the pen size grows as it is being drawn. Negative number means it shrinks. Positive number meanss it grows. Keeping it at zero keeps the size consistent.
- **Round end?**: Asking you if you want to have a rounded end for your line or not.
