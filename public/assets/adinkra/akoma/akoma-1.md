# Set up your script

To start your project, you need to use **When Clicked**, found in the Control category. Anything attached to the block will run when the green flag is clicked. The green flag can be found above the stage, or in the block itself.

To clear your stage of all stamps and pen trails, use **Clear**, located in the Pen category.

To move your sprite, use **Go to**, located in the Motion category. To move up, use a positive y value. To move down, use a negative value. To move left, use a negative x value. To move right, use a positive value.

To rotate your sprite, use **Point at Angle**, located in the Motion category. It rotates to the angle that you give it.

These five blocks set up the Akoma symbol with a starting location and rotation.
