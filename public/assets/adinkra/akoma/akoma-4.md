# Duplicate your code, and reverse it to create the second half

The final step is to complete the second half of the Akoma Adinkra symbol. The easiest way to do this is to **right-click on the "go to" block** and select **Duplicate**.

This will copy everything from that block downward.

To reflect the second half, make these changes to the duplicated blocks:

- Change the x value in the duplicated "go to" block from positive to negative.
- Change the boolean (True/False) value in the duplicated "log spiral" block to the opposite value (for example, from True to False, or vice versa).

This will create a mirrored second half of the symbol.
