# Draw the first log spiral

To create a spiral on the stage, use **log spiral**, located in the Pen category. It takes five values:

- **C(the coil value)**: Determines how tightly coiled your spiral is. Larger the number, tighter the coil. _Note: try to use values between 0.1 and 1_
- **Sweep**: The angle in which the log spiral stops at.
- **Size**: The size of the spiral.
- **Pen Growth**: The rate at which the pen size grows at. Keeping it at 0 gives it a consistent size throughout. A positive number grows the pen size as it draws. A negative number shrinks the size.
- **Clockwise?**: Asking you if you want your spiral to draw clockwise or counterclockwise.
