# Change the your variables every iteration using the “change by” Variable blocks

Drag in two “change by” Variable blocks and place them below the “translate” block in your “repeat” block.. In each “change by” block use the drop down menu to select the variables you just created: width and height.. Change the values in each “change by” block to 10.
