# Set your width and height variables by dragging in two “set to” Variable block

Drag in two “set to” Variable blocks, place them at the beginning of your script, and set them to 100 each. In the “set to” blocks use the drop down menu to select the variables you just created: width and height. Find the “width” and “height” Variable blocks that you just create and drag them into the aligning width and height values in the “arc” block.
