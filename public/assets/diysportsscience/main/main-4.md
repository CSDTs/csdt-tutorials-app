# Costumes

Let's change Lebron's costume based on his jump height!

- A **costume** is a picture that represents your character. In CSnap, you can change Lebron's appearance by using the **"Switch To Costume \_\_"** block.
- To make Lebron look like he's jumping, you might want to break up his jump into several parts and switch costumes as he moves.
- For example, you could use different costumes for these height ranges:
  - When **-120 < y < 20**
  - When **20 < y < 100**
  - When **100 < y < 130**

Try using the "Switch To Costume" block inside your loop to change Lebron's look as he jumps!
