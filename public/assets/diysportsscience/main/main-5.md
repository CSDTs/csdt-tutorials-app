# Intrastellar

So, you've made a simulation of jumping here on earth. But it's fun and simple to figure out how high you could jump on other planets. Try changing your acceleration (gravitational constant/"Set gravity to 9.8" block) for other planets. Where would you most like to play basketball?

| Planet  | Gravitational constant (m/sÂ²) |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| Earth   | 9.8                           |
| Mercury | 3.7                           |
| Venus   | 8.9                           |
| Moon    | 1.6                           |
| Mars    | 3.7                           |
| Jupiter | 23.1                          |
| Saturn  | 9                             |
| Uranus  | 8.7                           |
| Neptune | 11                            |
| Pluto   | 0.7                           |
