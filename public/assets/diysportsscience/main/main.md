# Setting Up Coordinates

Let's set the starting position for Lebron using x and y coordinates.

On the right, you'll see a program called CSnap. This tool lets you simulate basketball and many other things. To run your simulation, click the **"When Flag Clicked"** block in the center area. Now, whenever you click the green **Flag** icon, the simulation will start.

CSnap uses Cartesian coordinates. You can see the current coordinates by moving your mouse over the white stage areaâ€”the x and y values will appear below the box. Once you decide where you want Lebron to start, update the **"Go To X: \_\_ Y: \_\_"** block with your chosen coordinates.

After entering your coordinates, click the flag again to run the program. You can always adjust Lebron's position by changing the x and y values. Try to make Lebron the right size and height compared to the hoop!
